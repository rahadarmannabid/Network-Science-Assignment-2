## Network Science Assignemnt-2 Codes and Figures

You can run all the notebook in jupyter notebook. Some code may give error in mac m2 laptops. So I highly suggested to use linux system to run the codes. However, I used pymnet for showing visualization in problem 1 and rest of the problem is solved by networkx 
  
## Problem Description


Download Amazon product dataset from  http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Amazon.html, and  
compute: 

<br> 

a)  the size of the network largest connected component,  
b)  the number of connected components,  
c) degree distribution,  
d)  path length and  
e)  clustering coefficient.  
 
All metrics can be calculated using Python library NetworkX, but you can  use any specialized 
freely  available  packages  to  compute  these  properties,  or  you  develop  your  own  code.  Use 
visual  displays  (graphs/plots  generated  in a  software  of  your  choice,  e.g. gnuplot)  for  a  clear 
presentation.
